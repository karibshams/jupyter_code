CNN Image Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on building image classification models using:

✅ Custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
✅ Pretrained models (DenseNet, EfficientNet, ResNet, VGG)

Both approaches are implemented with:

K-Fold Cross-Validation

Standard Training (without K-Fold)

Model Summary
1️⃣ Custom CNN
Version	Description
CustomCNN_kfold_*.ipynb	Custom CNN with K-Fold Cross-Validation
CustomCNN_preraw_*.ipynb	Custom CNN standard training (no K-Fold)

(Replace with actual filenames if you have them, currently only pretrained files are visible)

2️⃣ Pretrained Models
Model Name	With K-Fold File	Without K-Fold File
DenseNet121	DenseNet121_kfold_Preraw.ipynb	DenseNet121preraw.ipynb
DenseNet201	(K-Fold filename missing)	DenseNet201preraw.ipynb (Assumed based on your pattern)
EfficientNetB3	EfficientNetB3_kfold_Preraw.ipynb	EfficientNetB3preraw.ipynb
ResNet50	ResNet50_kfold_Preraw.ipynb	ResNet50preraw.ipynb
VGG19	VGG19_kfold_Preraw.ipynb	VGG19preraw.ipynb

Features
✔️ Custom-built CNN models from scratch
✔️ Implementation of popular pretrained models using transfer learning
✔️ K-Fold Cross-Validation for robust performance evaluation
✔️ Option to train models without K-Fold for faster experiments
✔️ Uses .ipynb (Jupyter Notebooks) for easy experimentation and visualization

Technologies Used
TensorFlow / Keras

Python

Jupyter Notebooks

Scikit-learn (for K-Fold implementation)
Next Steps
✅ Ensure all model notebooks are cleaned and documented
✅ Add results comparison (accuracy, loss plots, etc.)
✅ Upload sample dataset or dataset instructions
